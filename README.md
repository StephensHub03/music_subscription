ðŸŽµðŸ’³ UI Design Spotlight: Music Subscription Card ðŸŽ§âœ¨

Proud to share a Music Subscription Card UI I designed using only HTML & CSS. It's a modern, minimal interface that showcases pricing plans and subscription options for a music platform.

ðŸ”¹ Key Highlights: ðŸŽ¶ Clean card layout with pricing details ðŸŽ¶ Highlighted plan features (e.g., ad-free, offline mode) ðŸŽ¶ Stylish typography and color contrast ðŸŽ¶ Responsive and visually engaging UI ðŸŽ¶ Perfect for landing pages or onboarding flows

ðŸ›  Tech Stack: âœ” HTML âœ” CSS (custom styles, flexbox, shadows) âœ” Font Awesome / Unicode icons âœ” Google Fonts

This was a great hands-on project to practice layout alignment, card design, and responsive styling â€” all with clean code and no frameworks.

Let me know your thoughts and feedback! Happy to collaborate or help others learning frontend development. ðŸš€
